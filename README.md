# Task 6 Report: Create and Evaluate Strong Passwords

## Cyber Security Internship

---

## Overview

This task aimed to develop an understanding of what makes a password strong by creating multiple passwords of varying complexity and evaluating their strength using online password strength tools. The project included researching common password attacks and summarizing best practices for password security.

## Tools Used

- Online password strength checker (e.g., passwordmeter.com)
- Text editor for note-taking and recording observations

## Procedure

1. Created multiple passwords with varied complexity, including different combinations of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, symbols, and lengths.
2. Tested each password using an online strength checker and noted the scores and feedback.
3. Investigated common password attacks such as brute force and dictionary attacks.
4. Summarized key tips and best practices to create strong passwords.

## Password Examples Tested

- `password123`
- `Strng@2025`
- `7&Fxl_pR9Jw$ZnQ`
- `/ayu/@3820\jfeb\__2025`

## Key Findings

- Passwords with a diverse combination of character types (upper/lowercase, digits, symbols) scored higher.
- Longer passwords generally provided better security.
- Passphrases consisting of multiple unrelated words combined with symbols were both strong and memorable.
- Enabling multi-factor authentication substantially enhances security beyond password strength alone.
- Using password managers can facilitate the use of complex and unique passwords safely.

## Best Practices for Password Security

- Use a minimum of 12 characters.
- Include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special symbols.
- Avoid common words, simple sequences, and repeated characters.
- Use passphrases that are easy to remember but difficult to guess.
- Enable multi-factor authentication wherever supported.
- Utilize password managers for secure password creation and storage.


## Summary

This task provided practical experience with password creation and evaluation, emphasizing the importance of length and complexity in password strength. Understanding common attack methods and best practices equips one to better protect accounts and data in real-world scenarios.
